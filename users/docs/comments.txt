1. Remove  Contact number from Users struct .
   	// Just thinking not to support contact number as it will keep changing often
   	// and it is bit complex with both country code and mobile number need to put together.
   	// Also, what will we do with the contact number. At this juncture we are not adding
   	// any functionality around it so lets get it removed

2. In addusers.go, line 29; I see that you are adding email to a key called user_name in DB and when checking
    for the documents in DB before insertion, you are looking for a key called email.
    Should you be not looking for user_name??

3. In addusers.go, line 64; you are returning the user which does not contain the id of the DB record.
  Can you make correction to return user with DB object ID included?? This ID will be useful in case of other operations.
